## TennisEye

TennisEye is a tennis ball speed calculation system. It is the first research publication to calculate the serve, groundstroke and volley speed of a tennis ball using a racket mounted motion sensor.

The motion sensor we used is a [UG sensor](https://ubibrothers.wordpress.com/) as shown in Fig.. It includes a triaxial acceleration sensor and a triaxial gyroscope. The measure range of the accelerometer and the gyroscope were set to be ± 16g and ± 2000◦/sec, respectively. Both sensors were sampled with 100 Hz. The UG sensor was fixed at the handle of the players’ rackets. Fig. 2 shows the sensor position and the coordinate system. We collected data in a tennis court that was equipped with a [PlaySight system](https://playsight.com/), which included six high definition (HD) cameras. The PlaySight system uses image processing algorithm to recognize stroke type, ball speed, and spin speed. 

We collected data from 7 players. Based on their self-report information, we divided the subjects into three categories: coach, regular player, and casual player. The coaches play several times per week, the regular players play one time per week, and the casual players play 0∼2 times per month. Table 2 shows the summary of tennis data we collected with a UG sensor. In total, we collected 569 serves, 1398 groundstrokes, and 18 volleys. All
